# LangGraph Infrastructure Verification Report

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Time:** 19:03 UTC
**Author:** System Administrator

## Overview

This report confirms the successful verification of the LangGraph infrastructure components, including database connectivity, schema usability, and Redis connectivity.

## Test Results

### Database Connectivity Test

✅ **PASSED**: Successfully connected to the Supabase Postgres database.

- Endpoint: `/health/db`
- Connection: Successful
- Database: `langgraph` on `supabase-langgraph` (via host.docker.internal)
- Test Query: `SELECT NOW()` executed successfully
- Timestamp: Successfully retrieved current timestamp from database
- Test Executed: October 1, 2025 at 19:02:54 UTC

### Schema Test

✅ **PASSED**: Successfully verified the `assignments` table schema and performed write/read operations.

- Table: `assignments` exists in the database
- Schema: Confirmed table has the following columns:
  - `id` (uuid, primary key)
  - `created_at` (timestamp with time zone)
  - `user_id` (text)
  - `team_id` (text)
  - `graph_id` (text)
  - `goal` (text)
  - `params` (jsonb)
  - `status` (text)
- Write Test: Successfully inserted a test record with ID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`
- Read Test: Successfully retrieved the inserted record
- Test Executed: October 1, 2025 at 19:02:54 UTC

### Redis Connectivity Test

✅ **PASSED**: Successfully connected to Redis and performed write/read operations.

- Endpoint: `/health/redis`
- Connection: Successful
- Redis: Connected to `langgraph-redis:6379`
- Write Test: Successfully wrote test key `health_check:test` with value `ok`
- Read Test: Successfully read back the test key with matching value
- Test Executed: October 1, 2025 at 18:55:22 UTC

## Infrastructure Components

- **API Server**: Node.js Express server running in Docker container
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 running in Docker container (supabase-langgraph)
- **Redis**: Redis 6 running in Docker container
- **Network**: All components successfully communicating via Docker networks

## Conclusion

All verification tests have passed successfully. The LangGraph infrastructure is properly configured and operational. The API server can connect to both the database and Redis, and can perform the necessary operations on the schema.

## Next Steps

The infrastructure is ready for production use. The following endpoints are available for health monitoring:

- `/health`: Basic API health check
- `/health/db`: Database connectivity and schema verification
- `/health/redis`: Redis connectivity verification
