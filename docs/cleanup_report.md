# LangGraphJS Cleanup Report

## Summary of Changes

### Removed Components
- The entire `langgraph-demo` directory has been fully removed from the repository
- All langgraph-demo containers have been stopped and removed
- No references to langgraph-demo remain in the active configuration

### Current Infrastructure
- Only the root setup remains active with the following components:
  - `langgraph-api` container: Node.js API service running on port 8123
  - `langgraph-redis` container: Redis service for internal use (not exposed externally)
  - `supabase-langgraph` container: Postgres database running on port 5433

### Dependency Management
- All dependencies are properly installed inside the Dockerfile build process
- The Dockerfile includes `npm install` during the build phase
- No dependencies are installed directly on the host system

### Validation
- Confirmed that all containers are running correctly
- Verified that the new endpoints and schema are properly configured
- Database connection is properly set to use supabase-langgraph on port 5433

## Conclusion
The LangGraphJS infrastructure has been successfully cleaned up. The old langgraph-demo setup has been completely removed, and only the new root setup remains active. All dependencies are properly managed within the container builds, and no host system installations are required.
