# LangGraph Infrastructure Setup Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the infrastructure setup for the LangGraph.js project. The setup has been configured to use the existing Supabase Postgres container instead of creating a new one.

## Changes Made

### 1. Docker Compose Configuration

- Created a new `docker-compose.yml` at the root of the project
- Configured two services:
  - `langgraph-api`: Using Node.js 20 Alpine image with volume mounting for development
  - `redis`: Redis service for caching and message queuing
- Excluded Postgres from the docker-compose file as we're using the existing Supabase Postgres container
- Added resource limits for both services (CPU and memory)
- Configured both services to run as non-root user (1000:1000)

### 2. Environment Configuration

- Created a new `.env` file with the following configurations:
  - Database connection to the existing Supabase Postgres container
  - Security keys (placeholders)
  - LangGraph API keys (placeholders)
  - Redis connection URL

### 3. LangGraph Configuration

- Created a `langgraph.json` file at the root of the project
- Configured environment variables and dependencies

### 4. Legacy Configuration

- The old demo configuration in `langgraph-demo/` has been left untouched but is now considered archived
- The new setup completely replaces the old demo setup

## Connection Details

- **Database**: Using the existing Supabase Postgres container (`supabase-langgraph`) running on port 5433:5432
- **Redis**: New Redis container running on port 6379:6379
- **API**: LangGraph API running on port 8123:8000

## Verification

- Confirmed that both containers start successfully
- Verified that the Redis service is accessible
- Confirmed that the API container can connect to the Redis service

## Conclusion

The LangGraph.js project now uses a clean infrastructure setup with:
- A dedicated docker-compose configuration
- Connection to the existing Supabase Postgres database
- No conflicts with the old demo setup
- Proper resource limits and security configurations
