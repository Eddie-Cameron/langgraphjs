# Security Recommendations for LangGraph.js Deployment

This document provides security recommendations for the LangGraph.js deployment, focusing on API key management and other security best practices.

## API Key Management

The current implementation has API keys stored directly in the `.env` file. While `.env` files are included in the `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits to version control, additional measures should be considered:

1. **Environment-Specific Configuration**: 
   - Use different `.env` files for different environments (development, staging, production)
   - Consider using a secrets management service for production deployments

2. **Key Rotation**:
   - Implement a regular schedule for rotating API keys
   - Update the `.env` file after each rotation

3. **Access Control**:
   - Restrict access to the `.env` file to only those who need it
   - Consider using environment variables set at the system level instead of `.env` files in production

## Docker Security

The current Docker setup could benefit from additional security measures:

1. **Non-Root User**:
   - Consider running containers with a non-root user
   - Add a `USER` directive to the Dockerfile

2. **Resource Limits**:
   - Set memory and CPU limits in the Docker Compose file
   - Example: `mem_limit: "1g"` and `cpus: "0.5"`

3. **Network Isolation**:
   - Use Docker networks to isolate services
   - Expose only necessary ports

## Database Security

The PostgreSQL database should be secured:

1. **Strong Passwords**:
   - Use a strong, unique password for the database
   - Store the password securely

2. **Network Access**:
   - Restrict network access to the database
   - Consider using SSL for database connections

## Regular Updates

Keep all components up to date:

1. **Dependencies**:
   - Regularly update npm packages
   - Check for security vulnerabilities with `npm audit`

2. **Docker Images**:
   - Use specific version tags for Docker images
   - Regularly update to the latest secure versions

## Implementation Plan

To implement these recommendations:

1. Create a secure key management strategy
2. Update Docker Compose configuration with security enhancements
3. Implement database security measures
4. Set up a regular update schedule

These measures will help ensure the security of your LangGraph.js deployment.
