# Security Hardening Report for LangGraph Infrastructure

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Author:** Security Engineer  

## Overview

This report documents the security hardening measures implemented for the LangGraph infrastructure based on the recommendations in `security_recommendations.md`. The implementation focused on API key management, Docker security, database security, and regular update practices.

## Implemented Recommendations

### 1. API Key Management

#### Environment-Specific Configuration
- ✅ Created separate `.env` files for different environments:
  - `.env.development` - For development environment
  - `.env.staging` - For staging environment
  - `.env.production` - For production environment
- ✅ Added clear documentation in each file about replacing placeholder values
- ✅ Confirmed `.env` is already in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

#### Key Rotation
- ✅ Created `key_rotation.md` documenting:
  - Regular schedule for rotating API keys (30/60/90 days depending on environment)
  - Detailed procedures for rotating different types of credentials
  - Emergency rotation procedures
  - Documentation requirements

#### Access Control
- ✅ Implemented file access restrictions in Docker containers:
  - Read-only volume mounts for application code
  - Non-root user execution for all containers

### 2. Docker Security

#### Non-Root User
- ✅ Created Dockerfile with `USER` directive to run as non-root user
- ✅ Added user creation and proper permissions in Dockerfile
- ✅ Updated docker-compose.yml to run services as non-root users

#### Resource Limits
- ✅ Set memory and CPU limits in docker-compose.yml:
  - API: 1 CPU, 1GB memory
  - Redis: 0.5 CPU, 512MB memory

#### Network Isolation
- ✅ Configured Docker network for service isolation
- ✅ Removed external port mapping for Redis (only accessible within Docker network)
- ✅ Only exposed necessary API port (8123)

### 3. Database Security

#### Strong Passwords
- ✅ Created SQL script (`set_postgres_password.sql`) to set a strong password
- ✅ Updated environment files with placeholders for strong passwords
- ✅ Added documentation on password rotation

#### Network Access
- ✅ Restricted database access to only be available within Docker network
- ✅ Removed unnecessary port exposures

### 4. Regular Updates

#### Dependencies
- ✅ Pinned Docker images to specific versions:
  - Node.js: 20.11.1-alpine (instead of floating 20-alpine)
  - Redis: 6.2.14-alpine (instead of floating 6)

#### Docker Images
- ✅ Specified exact versions for all Docker images
- ✅ Added restart policies to ensure services remain available

## Limitations and TODOs for Production

1. **SSL for Database Connections**
   - Not implemented in this phase
   - Recommended for production deployment
   - Requires additional configuration of PostgreSQL

2. **Secrets Management Service**
   - Current implementation uses `.env` files
   - For production, consider using a dedicated secrets management service
   - Options include HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault

3. **Network Segmentation**
   - Current implementation uses basic Docker networking
   - For production, consider more advanced network segmentation
   - Implement proper firewall rules and VPC configuration

4. **Automated Security Scanning**
   - Implement regular security scanning of Docker images
   - Add automated vulnerability scanning to CI/CD pipeline
   - Consider tools like Trivy, Clair, or Snyk

5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Implement comprehensive logging for security events
   - Set up monitoring for unusual access patterns
   - Consider integrating with a SIEM solution

## Verification Steps

To verify the security hardening measures:

1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers
2. Confirm all services start successfully with non-root users
3. Verify API can connect to database with updated credentials
4. Confirm Redis is only accessible internally
5. Test API endpoints to ensure functionality is maintained

## Conclusion

The implemented security hardening measures significantly improve the security posture of the LangGraph infrastructure. The changes address the key recommendations while maintaining functionality. For production deployment, the additional TODOs should be addressed to further enhance security.
