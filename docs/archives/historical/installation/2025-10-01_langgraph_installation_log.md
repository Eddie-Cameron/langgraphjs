### 2. Repository Documentation Analysis
```
# Comparing our installation plan with repository documentation

Key findings:
- Repository uses Python-based CLI tool: `pip install -U langgraph-cli`
- Specific application structure required with `langgraph.json` configuration file
- Docker Compose example in documentation already uses port 8123 (matching our selection)
- Repository provides detailed Docker Compose configuration for Redis and PostgreSQL
- MCP server integration not explicitly mentioned in self-hosted deployment guide

Our installation plan generally aligns with repository documentation, but we need to:
1. Use the Python-based `langgraph-cli` to build the Docker image
2. Create proper application structure with `langgraph.json`
3. Follow the Docker Compose configuration provided in documentation
```
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Notes:** Will follow repository documentation for installation process.

### 3. Installation Process Clarification
```
# Clarifying the installation process

The LangGraph installation process involves:

1. Host Machine Requirements:
   - Node.js and npm (to install the LangGraph.js CLI)
   - Docker and Docker Compose (to run the containers)

2. Installation Steps:
   - Install LangGraph.js CLI on the host machine (npm install @langchain/langgraph-cli)
   - Use the CLI to build a Docker image with LangGraph Server
   - Create Docker Compose file for Redis and PostgreSQL
   - Run the Docker containers

3. Component Roles:
   - LangGraph.js CLI: Tool on host machine to build Docker image
   - Docker Image: Contains LangGraph Server
   - Docker Compose: Manages Redis, PostgreSQL, and LangGraph Server containers
```
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Notes:** CORRECTION: We need to use the JavaScript version of the LangGraph CLI (from NPM), not the Python version. This makes sense since we're in the langgraphjs repository.

### 4. Installation Approach Correction
```
# Correcting our installation approach

Initial approach error:
- Attempted to install Python-based CLI (langgraph-cli)
- Encountered Python environment management issues

Correct approach:
- Use JavaScript-based CLI (@langchain/langgraph-cli)
- Install via npm/yarn/pnpm
- CLI commands are the same (build, dev, up, dockerfile)

Documentation reference:
- LangGraph.js CLI can be installed from NPM registry
- Commands include: build, dev, up, dockerfile
- The CLI builds Docker images for LangGraph API server
```
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Notes:** Successfully installed the JavaScript-based CLI. The command is `langgraphjs` (not `langgraph`), and we can use it with npx: `npx @langchain/langgraph-cli`.

### 5. LangGraph.js CLI Installation
```
# Installing LangGraph.js CLI

Command:
npm install -g @langchain/langgraph-cli

Output:
added 198 packages in 10s

- dockerfile: Generate a Dockerfile for the LangGraph API server
- build: Build LangGraph API server Docker image
- up: Launch LangGraph API server
- sysinfo: Print system information
```
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Notes:** The CLI is installed and working correctly. We'll use it to build the Docker image for LangGraph Server.

### 6. LangGraph Application Structure Creation
```
# Creating LangGraph application structure

Created directory:
mkdir -p langgraph-demo

Created agent.js:
