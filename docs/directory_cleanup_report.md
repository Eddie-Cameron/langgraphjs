# Directory Cleanup Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the directory structure cleanup performed on the LangGraphJS repository. The goal was to create a more organized foundation to support agents, teams, graphs, and documentation as the project expands.

## Changes Made

### New Directory Structure

The following directories were created at the project root:

- `/agents/` - For individual agent definitions (prompts, configs, roles)
- `/teams/` - For team graphs (e.g., team_generic, future project-specific teams)
- `/graphs/` - For reusable graph templates and flows
- `/tests/` - For validation and integration tests
- `/docs/` - For living documentation (reports, analysis, endpoints, recommendations)
- `/archives/` - For old configs, logs, and historical migrations

### File Reorganization

#### Moved to /docs/

The following documentation files were moved from the root directory to `/docs/`:
- endpoint_documentation_update.md
- langgraph_analysis_summary.md
- langgraph_endpoints.md
- langgraph_setup_report.md
- network_connectivity_plan.md
- security_hardening_report.md
- security_recommendations.md
- verification_report.md
- cleanup_recommendations.md
- cleanup_report.md

#### Moved to /archives/

The following historical logs and plans were moved from the root directory to `/archives/`:
- langgraph_installation_log.md
- langgraph_installation_plan.md
- langgraph_validation_tests.md
- key_rotation.md

### Cleanup of langgraph-demo References

The langgraph-demo directory had already been removed from the repository as part of previous cleanup efforts. References to langgraph-demo in documentation files were kept as they provide historical context about the evolution of the project.

## Files Kept at Root

The following infrastructure and entrypoint files were kept at the root level:
- docker-compose.yml
- Dockerfile
- .env.* files
- package.json
- server.js
- Other configuration files

## Conclusion

The repository now has a clean, organized directory structure that will better support the development of agents, teams, and graphs. The documentation is properly organized in the `/docs/` directory, and historical files are archived in the `/archives/` directory. This structure provides a solid foundation for future development and expansion of the LangGraphJS project.
